            Detailed terms and conditions of the money-back guarantee:
          </p>
          <ul className='list-disc ml-5 pl-3'>
            <li className='mb-2'>You receive a refund equal to the US $ price you paid.</li>
            <li className='mb-2'>
              Your refund is issued in the currency you used, but for the US $ value.
            </li>
            <li className='mb-2'>
              Terms and conditions of the credit card payment processor apply to credit card
              refunds.
            </li>
            <li className='mb-2'>We will bear the cryptocurrency refund transaction fees.</li>
          </ul>
          <p className='mb-2 mt-5 text-2xl'>What does this mean?</p>
          <p className='mb-5'>
            For example, if you paid BTC worth US $1000, you will receive BTC worth US $1000 using
            the exchange rate at the time of the refund.
          </p>
          <p className='mb-5'>
            Letâ€™s assume that US $1000 = 0.001 BTC at the time of your purchase.
          </p>
          <ul className='list-disc ml-5 pl-3'>
            <li className='mb-2'>
              If the price of BTC doubles in the time elapsed from your purchase, you will receive a
              US $1000 value but half the amount of BTC (0.0005 BTC = worth US $1000).
            </li>
            <li className='mb-2'>
              Conversely, if the price of BTC plummets by half in that time, you will receive a US
              $1000 value but twice the amount of BTC (0.002 BTC = US $1000).
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p className='mb-2 mt-5 text-2xl'>This policy:</p>
          <ul className='list-disc ml-5 pl-3'>
            <li className='mb-2'>Avoids capital gains/losses on refunds.</li>
            <li className='mb-2'>Simplifies US tax accounting.</li>
            <li className='mb-2'>
              Ensures that no one (neither you nor we) misuses this money-back guarantee as a way to
              speculate on the US $ price of Bitcoin.
